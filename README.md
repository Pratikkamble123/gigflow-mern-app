## 🧠 Hiring Workflow

1. A user posts a gig.
2. Other users submit bids.
3. The gig owner reviews bids.
4. The owner clicks “Hire” on one bid.
5. The gig becomes assigned.
6. The selected freelancer is hired.
7. All other bids are automatically rejected.

This logic is handled atomically to ensure data consistency.
